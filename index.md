## About Me

Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at Sorbonne Université in Paris, France. My work focuses on studying theoretical stochastic/deterministic dynamics for optimization problems. I am particularly interested in the possible applications to Machine Learning, related to variance reduction methods and continuous optimization.
